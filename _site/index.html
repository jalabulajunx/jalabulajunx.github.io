  <h3>Commentary</h3>

    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p style="font-size: 1.2em; text-align: justify;">
  <a name="fn1">1.</a> The Client had migrated their primary platform applicaiton from legacy to latest technologies. While that was completed, the corections department was still on the legacy, as it needed customized solutions on the new platform for every department. The legacy corrections solution was bringing in size-able revenue <mark>(15% of the total annual revenue)</mark>. So, we built a platform where UIs and underlying interactions can be <mark>built on the go and deployed at sites without a need for release</mark>.<br /><br />
  <a name="fn2">2.</a> Similar to corrections solution, another applicaiton residing on older technology needed a migration. The caveat: It had the <mark>highest ever NPS</mark> and also was bringing in <mark>annual revenue of over $30M</mark>. The migration strategy needed to be constructed carefully so that it does not impact the customers migrating, and also has the least impact on learning. After extensive UX research and many interviews later, we are on the cusp of releasing a product that will be superior to the Classic - and are hoping that we <mark>do not pull a Windows Vista</mark> &#128521;.<br /><br />
  <a name="fn3">3.</a> The new platform is a giant with <mark>millions of daily transaction</mark>. In order to understand the workflow of users and customers, I had built reports using <mark>Elastic DSL queries on Kibana</mark> platform. Also, in order to <mark>troubleshoot issues</mark> reported by customers, <mark>AWS logs</mark> were queried to undertand their problems.
